    "# Homework: Build Your Own dlt Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen how to build a pipeline with a scaffolded source. Now it's your turn to do it from scratch with a **custom API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Content\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Workshop README](README.md)\n",
    "* [dlt Pipeline Overview Notebook (Google Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/anair123/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/workshop/dlt_2026/cohorts/2026/workshops/dlt/dlt_Pipeline_Overview.ipynb)\n",
    "* [Workshop registration page](https://luma.com/hzis1yzp)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework, build a dlt pipeline that loads NYC taxi trip data from a custom API into DuckDB and then answer some questions using the loaded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be working with **NYC Yellow Taxi trip data** from a custom API (not available as a dlt scaffold). This dataset contains records of individual taxi trips in New York City.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Property | Value |\n",
    "|----------|-------|\n",
    "| Base URL | `https://us-central1-dlthub-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/data_engineering_zoomcamp_api` |\n",
    "| Format | Paginated JSON |\n",
    "| Page Size | 1,000 records per page |\n",
    "| Pagination | Stop when an empty page is returned |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this API is custom (not one of the scaffolds in dlt workspace), the setup is slightly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a New Project (or Reuse Your Demo Project)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already created a project folder while following along with the workshop demo, you can reuse that folder. Otherwise, create a new one:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir taxi-pipeline\n",
    "cd taxi-pipeline\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open this folder in Cursor (or your preferred agentic IDE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Set Up the dlt MCP Server (If Not Already Done)\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the setup for your IDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cursor - go to **Settings → Tools & MCP → New MCP Server** and add:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"mcpServers\": {\n",
    "    \"dlt\": {\n",
    "      \"command\": \"uv\",\n",
    "      \"args\": [\n",
    "        \"run\",\n",
    "        \"--with\",\n",
    "        \"dlt[duckdb]\",\n",
    "        \"--with\",\n",
    "        \"dlt-mcp[search]\",\n",
    "        \"python\",\n",
    "        \"-m\",\n",
    "        \"dlt_mcp\"\n",
    "      ]\n",

    "  \"servers\": {\n",
    "    \"dlt\": {\n",
    "      \"command\": \"uv\",\n",

    "      ]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Code - run in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "claude mcp add dlt -- uv run --with \"dlt[duckdb]\" --with \"dlt-mcp[search]\" python -m dlt_mcp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables the dlt MCP server, giving the AI access to dlt documentation, code examples, and your pipeline metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Install dlt\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install \"dlt[workspace]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Initialize the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dlt init dlthub:taxi_pipeline duckdb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can name the project whatever you like. Since this API has no scaffold, the command will create:\n",
    "- The dlt project files\n",
    "- Cursor rules for AI assistance\n",
    "\n",
    "**But no YAML file with API metadata.** You will need to provide the API information yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Prompt the Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Now use your AI assistant to build the pipeline. You'll need to provide the API details in your prompt since there's no scaffold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Build a REST API source for NYC taxi data.\n",
    "\n",
    "API details:\n",
    "- Base URL: https://us-central1-dlthub-analytics.cloudfunctions.net/data_engineering_zoomcamp_api\n",
    "- Data format: Paginated JSON (1,000 records per page)\n",
    "- Pagination: Stop when an empty page is returned\n",
    "\n",
    "Place the code in taxi_pipeline.py and name the pipeline taxi_pipeline.\n",
    "Use @dlt rest api as a tutorial.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Run and Debug\n",
    "\n",
    "Run your pipeline and iterate with the agent until it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python taxi_pipeline.py\n",
    "```\n",
