    "# Module 5 Homework: Data Platforms with Bruin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we'll use Bruin to build a complete data pipeline, from ingestion to reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Bruin CLI: `curl -LsSf https://getbruin.com/install/cli | sh`\n",
    "2. Initialize the zoomcamp template: `bruin init zoomcamp my-pipeline`\n",
    "3. Configure your `.bruin.yml` with a DuckDB connection\n",
    "4. Follow the tutorial in the [main module README](../../../05-data-platforms/)\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the setup, you should have a working NYC taxi data pipeline.\n",
