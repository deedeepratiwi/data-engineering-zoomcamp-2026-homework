    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a hint, Kestra makes that process really easy:\n",
    "1. You can leverage the backfill functionality in the [scheduled flow](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/02-workflow-orchestration/flows/09_gcp_taxi_scheduled.yaml) to backfill the data for the year 2021. Just make sure to select the time period for which data exists i.e. from `2021-01-01` to `2021-07-31`. Also, make sure to do the same for both `yellow` and `green` taxi data (select the right service in the `taxi` input).\n",
    "2. Alternatively, run the flow manually for each of the seven months of 2021 for both `yellow` and `green` taxi data. Challenge for you: find out how to loop over the combination of Year-Month and `taxi`-type using `ForEach` task which triggers the flow for each combination using a `Subflow` task.\n",
