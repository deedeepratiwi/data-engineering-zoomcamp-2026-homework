    "# Module 4 Homework: Analytics Engineering with dbt\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, we'll use the dbt project in `04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/` to transform NYC taxi data and answer questions by querying the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up your dbt project following the [setup guide](../../../04-analytics-engineering/setup/)\n",
    "2. Load the Green and Yellow taxi data for 2019-2020 into your warehouse\n",
    "3. Run `dbt build --target prod` to create all models and run tests\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** By default, dbt uses the `dev` target. You must use `--target prod` to build the models in the production dataset, which is required for the homework queries below.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a successful build, you should have models like `fct_trips`, `dim_zones`, and `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` in your warehouse.\n",

    "```\n",
    "models/\n",
    "├── staging/\n",
    "│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql\n",

    "\n",
    "When you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, dbt will build the specified model (`int_trips_unioned`) along with any of its upstream dependencies. In this case, `int_trips_unioned` depends on both `stg_green_tripdata` and `stg_yellow_tripdata`, so those models will also be built. Downstream models that depend on `int_trips_unioned` will not be built unless explicitly selected.\n",
