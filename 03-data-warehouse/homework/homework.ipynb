    "# Module 3 Homework: Data Warehousing & BigQuery\n",

    "In this homework we'll practice working with BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can use the following scripts to load the data into your GCS bucket:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python script: [load_yellow_taxi_data.py](./load_yellow_taxi_data.py)\n",
    "- Jupyter notebook with DLT: [DLT_upload_to_GCP.ipynb](./DLT_upload_to_GCP.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to generate a Service Account with GCS Admin privileges or be authenticated with the Google SDK, and update the bucket name in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using orchestration tools such as Kestra, Mage, Airflow, or Prefect, do not load the data into BigQuery using the orchestrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that all 6 files show in your GCS bucket before beginning.\n",
